openlpc-USB_Bootloader
======================

This repository contains a USB bootloader compatible with the LPC17xx
microcontroller. The lineage of this bootloader:

* Originally based off of NXP's [AN10866 LPC1700 secondary
  bootloader](http://www.lpcware.com/content/nxpfile/an10866-lpc1700-secondary-usb-bootloader)
* Code Red modified the bootloader to use the BSD licensed LPCUSB library,
  instead of the restrictively licensed USB stack from Keil (which could only be
  used with the uVision/ARM development tools).
* Modifications made for OpenLPC project (not sure on the details)
* Chris Peplin replaced Code Red's fork of the LPCUSB library with a Git
  submodule pointing to a branch in the LPCUSB library that supports the
  LPC17xx, and re-used as many example files from the LPCUSB project directly.
* Chris also replaced the startup files with a Git submodule pointer to the ARM
  CDL project.

## Installing the Bootloader

    $ script/bootstrap.sh
    $ cd src
    $ make

Assuming you have an Olimex ARM-OCD-USB JTAG adapter plugged in, connected to
the board and the board powered up:

    $ make flash

## Building User Firmware

See the simple program in the `example` directory for an example of how to build
a program for the bootloader.

The only change required is your linker script - instead of starting the user
program at flash memory location 0, start it at `0x10000`, e.g.:

    FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x10000, LENGTH = 512K - 0x10000

If you are using the `SystemInit()` function from the ARM CDL, be aware that it
sets the vector table offset register (`VTOR`) back to `0`, so interrupts will
not work. A workaround is to manually set the `VTOR` to the location of your
interrupt vectors at startup:

    void Reset_Handler(void) {
        SystemInit();
        SCB->VTOR = (uint32_t) interrupt_vectors;
        ...
    }

This workaround doesn't have any negative effects if you use the same code
running on bare metal.

## Flashing User Code

### Windows / OS X

To flash, hold down the bootloader entry button while plugging into USB or
hitting the reset button. A USB drive should appear.

* Delete the firmware.bin file
* Copy your new firmware.bin over (the filename doesn't matter)
* Unmount and reset the microcontroller

### Linux

Mounting the USB and copying over the firmware [does not
work](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/LPC_ARM_quick_start#Bootloaders) from
Linux. You need to use `mdel` and `mcopy` from the `mtools` package.

To flash, hold down the bootloader entry button while powering on. Then:

    $ sudo mdel -i /dev/sdc ::/firmware.bin
    $ sudo mcopy -i /dev/sdc firmware.bin ::/firmware.bin

where `/dev/sdc` is the device name of the LPC17xx. No need to unmount or
anything after that, just reset the board.

There's a utility script at `example/flash.sh` to automate these two steps,
since sometimes it can take a few seconds before the LPC17xx filesystem can be
written, and you have to keep retrying the mdel command. Run it like so:

    $ ./flash.sh /dev/sdc new-firmware.bin
