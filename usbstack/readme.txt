Code Red Technologies RDB1768 Board - USB Stack Example
=======================================================

The USB stack and associated examples provided with RDB1768 board are
based on the open source LPCUSB stack, originally written for the NXP
LPC214x microcontrollers. The original sources for the USB stack and
and examples can be found at:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpcusb/

with additional information at:

  http://wiki.sikken.nl/index.php?title=LPCUSB

We have tried to keep the changes to the codebase down to a minimum, and
have commented where changes have been made as much as possible
